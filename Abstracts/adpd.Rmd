13.   AN OPEN-SCIENCE ADNI STUDY USING THE ANTS LONGITUDINAL CORTICAL THICKNESS PIPELINE

THE ANTS LONGITUDINAL CORTICAL THICKNESS PIPELINE

Objectives: Quantification of brain morphology has proven invaluable in studying
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.  We present a longitudinal
extension of the well-known ANTs cortical thickness pipeline [1] which takes into
account various sources of bias which have been discussed in the literature.
Evaluation is performed using clinical data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI 1).

Methods:  For each subject, all time point T1-weighted images are used to generate
an unbiased single-subject template (SST). Individual SST tissue probability maps
are then generated from an ADNI-specific template and joint label fusion (JLF) of
publicly available labeled data based on the OASIS data set.  The T1-weighted image
at each time point is rigidly aligned to the SST and processed through original
pipeline using the SST template and corresponding tissue probability images.   
Cortical labelings based on the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) protocol [2]
were used to quantify ROI-based mean thickness values.

Results:  Comparison between the cross-sectional [1] and proposed longitudinal
pipelines was based on minimizing within-subject variability and maximizing
between-subject variability in the measured regional cortical thickness values.  
To assess this variance criterion while accounting for changes that may occur
through the passage of time, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model for parameter
estimation.  These parameters were used to obtain a normed variance ratio for
comparison of the two processing methods for each of the 62 DKT regions.  The
longitudinal pipeline demonstrated superior variance-based performance in 38
out of the 62 DKT regions.

Conclusions:  The proposed open-source cortical thickness pipeline demonstrates
robustness and performance improvement for longitudinal studies such as ADNI.
