Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain
have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the
concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools
for quantifying neurostructural changes.  Longitudinal-specific strategies
for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including
more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power.
Using the first phase of the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) data,
comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months,
we evaluate the utility of longitudinal FreeSurfer and ANTs surrogate thickness values
in the context of a longitudinal mixed-effects (LME) modeling strategy.
Specifically, we estimate the residual variability and
between-subject variability associated with each processing stream as it
is known from the statistical literature that minimizing the former while
simultaneously maximizing the latter
leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals
in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower
confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects. This
strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the
Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with
the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams.
Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the
ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed
ANTs longitudinal framework which
provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive
to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.
