\caption{Diagrammatic illustration of the ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness pipeline
for a single subject with $N$ time points.  From the $N$ original T1-weighted
images (left column, yellow panel) and the group template and priors (bottom row,
green panel), the single-subject template (SST) and auxiliary prior images
are created (center, blue panel).  These subject-specific template and other
auxiliary images are used to generate the individual time-point cortical
thickness maps, in the individual time point's native space (denoted as
``ANTs Native'' in the text).  Optionally, one can
rigidly transform the time-point images prior to segmentation and cortical thickness
estimation (right column, red panel).  This alternative processing scheme is referred
to as ``ANTs SST''.  For regional thickness values, regional labels
are propagated to each image using a given atlas set (with cortical labels)
and joint label fusion.}

cognitively normal subjects
of the ADNI-1 database.  The prior probability mask for the whole brain (middle row)
and the six tissue priors (bottom row) are used to ``seed'' each single-subject template for creation of
a probabilistic brain mask and probabilistic tissues priors during longitudinal
processing.}

\caption{95\% credible intervals of the region-specific variance ratios
$r^k=\tau_k/\sigma_k$ are presented for each processing method.  The ANTs
SST method dominates the others across the majority of
regions---its point estimates (posterior medians) are greater than those of the other
processing methods except for the left and right EC values in
FreeSurfer Long (although there is significant overlap in the credible intervals
in those regions).
These results also suggest that longitudinal processing is to be
preferred for both packages.}
