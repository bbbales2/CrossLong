## ADNI-1 imaging data


The strict protocol design, large-scale recruitment, and public availability of
the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) makes it
an ideal data set for evaluating the ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness pipeline.
An MP-RAGE [@Mugler:1990aa] sequence for 1.5 and 3.0 T was used to collect the data
at the scan sites.  Specific acquisition parameters for 1.5 T and 3.0 T magnets
are given in Table 1 of [@Jack:2008aa].  As proposed, collection goals were
200 elderly cognitively normal subjects collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months;
400 MCI subjects at risk for AD conversion at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months; and
200 AD subjects at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months.

The ADNI-1 data were downloaded in May of 2014 and first processed using
the ANTs cross-sectional cortical thickness pipeline [@Tustison:2014ab]
(4399 total images).  Data was then processed using two variants of the ANTs longitudinal
stream (described in the next section).  In the final set of csv files (which we have
made publicly available in the GitHub repository associated with this work[^1]),
we only included
time points for which clinical scores (e.g., MMSE) were available.  In total,
we included 197 cognitive normals, 324 LMCI subjects,
and 142 AD subjects \textcolor{black}{with one or more follow-up image acquisition appointments}.
