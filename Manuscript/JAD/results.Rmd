# Results

All imaging data were processed through the five processing streams
(i.e., FS Cross, FS Long, ANTs Cross, ANTs SST, and ANTs Native)
on the high performance computing cluster  at the University of California,
Irvine (UCI).  Based on the evaluation design described in the previous section,
we compare pipeline performance when applied to the ADNI-1 data.
Specifically, we calculate the variance ratios, described in Section 2.5,
for each of the 62 DKT regions for each of the five pipelines.  These are
compared and discussed.  We then explore how this general criterion for
evaluating measurement quality applies specifically to a longitudinal analysis of
the ADNI-1 data in discriminating the diagnostic stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

After processing the image data through the various pipelines, we tabulated
the regional thickness values and made them available as .csv
files online in the corresonding GitHub repository.[^5]
We also provide the Perl scripts used to run the pipelines on the UCI cluster
and the R scripts used to do the analysis below.  Additional figures and plots
have also been created which were not included in this work.  For example,
spaghetti plots showing absolute thickness and longitudinal thickness changes are
contained in the
subdirectory CrossLong/Data/RegionalThicknessSpaghettiPlots/.

## Cortical residual and between-subject thickness variability

$r^k=\tau_k/\sigma_k$ are presented for each processing method.  The ANTs
SST method dominates the others across the majority of
regions---its point estimates (posterior medians) are greater than those of the other
processing methods except for the left and right EC values in
FreeSurfer Long (although there is significant overlap in the credible intervals
in those regions).
These results also suggest that longitudinal processing is to be
preferred for both packages.}
\label{fig:ratios}
\end{figure}

The LME model defined in (\ref{eq::lme1}) was used to quantify the between-subject
and residual variance with the expectation that maximizing the former while minimizing
the latter optimizes measurement quality in terms of prediction and confidence intervals.
Figure \ref{fig:ratios} provides the resulting 95\% credible intervals
for the distributions of region-specific variance ratios $r^k = \tau_k / \sigma_k$
for each of the five pipelines.  Based on the discussion in the previous section,
superior methododologies are designated by larger variance ratios.

between subject variability, and ratio of the between-subject variability and
residual variability for each of the 62 DKT regions.  Note that the
``better'' measurement maximizes this latter ratio.}
\label{fig:variance_boxplots}
\end{figure}

ANTs SST has the highest ratio variance across most of the 62 regions over the
other methods.  It rarely overlaps with ANTs Native and never with
ANTs Cross.  In contrast to the majority of FreeSurfer regional ratio variances (from
both FS Cross and FS Long) which are smaller than those of the ANTs pipelines,
FS Long has larger ratio values for the EC region with the only overlap in the
credible intervals with ANTs SST.

\end{figure}

The plot in
Figure \ref{fig:variance_boxplots} shows a relative summary of all the regional quantities
for all three variance measurements (residual, between-subject, and variance
ratio) via box plots.  These relative distributions show
that both between-subject and residual quantities contribute to the disparities
in the ratio evaluation metric.  Finally, we overlay the variance ratio values on the
corresponding regions of a 3-D rendering of the ADNI template (Figure \ref{fig:brain_variance})
to provide an additional visual comparison between the methods.

## Regional diagnostic contrasts based on cortical atrophy

\end{figure}

The LME model described in Equation (3) was used to determine region-by-region contrasts
for each pairing LMCI$-$CN, AD$-$LMCI, and AD$-$CN using post-hoc Tukey
significance testing.  It should be noted that
no subjects were included that switched diagnostic groups during the acquired study
schedule.  These findings are provided in Tables 2 and 3.
The adjusted $p$-values were log-scaled for use in specifying the individual color
cell for facilitating visual differentiation.  Each cell contains the corresponding
95\% confidence intervals.  Figure \ref{fig:logpvalues} provides a side-by-side comparison of the
distribution of log-scaled $p$-values separated into left and right hemispherical
components and grouped according to contrast.


Consideration of performance over all three diagnostic pairings illustrates the superiority
of the longitudinal ANTs methodologies over their ANTs cross-sectional counterpart.  Several
regions demonstrating statistically significant non-zero atrophy in ANTs Native and ANTs SST
do not manifest similar trends in ANTs Cross.  Pronounced
differences between the ANTs longitudinal vs. cross-sectional methodologies can be seen in
both the LMCI$-$CN and AD$-$CN contrasts.  Although ANTs Cross demonstrates discriminative
capabilities throughout the cortex and, specifically, in certain AD salient regions, such
as the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, the contrast is not nearly as strong as the
other methods including FS Cross and FS Long thus motivating the use of longitudinal considerations
for processing of AD data.

Differentiation between the longitudinal methods is not as obvious although trends certainly
exist.  In general, for differentiating CN vs. LMCI, all methods are comparable except for
ANTs Cross.  However, for the other two diagnostic contrasts AD$-$LMCI and AD$-$CN, the
trend is similar to what we found in the evaluation via the variance ratio, viz., the
longitudinal ANTs methods tend towards greater contrast means versus ANTs Cross and the
two FreeSurfer methods.  Looking at specific cortical areas, though, we see that comparable
regions (``comparable'' in terms of variance ratio) are consistent with previous findings.
For example, we noted in the last section that FSLong has a relatively large variance ratio
in the entorhinal regions which is consistent with the results seen in Tables 2 and 3.
