Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain
have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the
concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools
for quantifying neurostructural changes.  Longitudinal-specific strategies
for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including
more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power.
In this work, we introduce the open-source Advanced Normalization Tools
(ANTs) registration-based cortical thickness longitudinal processing 
pipeline and its application
to the first phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1)
comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months.
We demonstrate in these data that the single-subject template
construction and same orientation processing results
in a simultaneous minimization of residual variability and maximization of
between-subject variability immediately estimable from a longitudinal mixed-effects
modeling strategy.  It is known from the statistical literature that
optimizing these dual criteria
leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals
in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower
confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects.  This
strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the
Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with
the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams.
\textcolor{blue}{
Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the 
ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed 
ANTs longitudinal framework which
}
provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive 
to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.
