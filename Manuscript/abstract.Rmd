# Abstract

Large-scale longitudinal studies of developmental progression or disease in the human brain
have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the
concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools
for insight into potential neurostructural changes.  Longitudinal-specific strategies
for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including
the reduction of the inter-subject variability associated with cross-sectional
studies.  In this work, we introduce the open-source Advanced Normalization Tools
(ANTs) cortical thickness longitudinal processing pipeline and its application
on the first phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1)
consisting of over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months.
We demonstrate that single-subject template construction and native subject-space processing
localizes data transformations and reduces interpolation artifacts, respectively,
and is the preferred strategy for minimizing within-subject variability and maximizing
between-subject variability.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that these criteria
lead to greater clinical interpretability over other processing strategies.
