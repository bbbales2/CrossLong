Herein we detailed the ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness framework which
is designed to take advantage of longitudinal data acquisition protocols while
accounting for the various bias issues that have been associated with processing
such data.  Over 600 subjects from the well-known longitudinal ADNI-1 data set
with diagnoses distributed between cognitively normal, MCI, LMCI, and AD were
processed through the original ANTs cross-sectional framework [@Tustison:2014ab] and
two longitudinal variants.  One of the variants, ANTs SST, is
similar to the FreeSurfer longitudinal stream in that each time-point image is
reoriented to an unbiased single-subject template for subsequent processing.
ANTs Native, in contrast, estimates cortical thickness in the native
space while also using tissue prior probabilities generated from the SST.  

Comparative assessment utilized LME models to determine the between-subject to
within-subject variance ratios over the 62 regions of the brain defined by the
DKT parcellation scheme where higher values indicate greater discriminative
capacity.  In these terms, ANTs Native outperformed all other pipeline variants
including both the FreeSurfer longitudinal and cross-sectional streams.
Regional disparities between the ANTs Native and SST pipelines point to increases
in both between-subject and within-subject variances which might be due to interpolation
artifacts.  In other words, interpolation potentially has a systematic but regionally varying effect.
Investigation of this issue is the subject of future research.

One very interesting finding was the superior performance of FS Long in the EC regions where
the variance ratios was slightly larger than those of ANTs Native where the credible intervals
have significant overlap.  Given the  small volume and indistinguishability from surrounding
structures, segmentation of the EC can be relatively difficult} [@price2010]\textcolor{black}{.
This segmentation complexity has led to EC-specific} [@Fischl:2009aa] \textcolor{black}{and related}
[@Augustinack:2013aa] \textcolor{black}{strategies for targeted regional processing.  
For this work, we wanted to avoid such tuning and simply employ off-the-shelf
input parameters and data.  Future work will explore refining input template priors
in these problematic regions for ANTs-based estimation of cortical thickness.

Additional assessments included similar variance quantification in the EC
and diagnostic prediction using extreme gradient boosting models.  The
former evaluation was motivated by the prominence of the EC as a biomarker
in AD progression whereas the latter coupled a simplistic assumption of AD
progression with modern machine learning techniques similar in spirit to what
we did in our previous work [@Tustison:2014ab].  Both assessments supported the
findings of the first assessment in demonstrating the superiority of
Longitudinal-native.  These findings promote longitudinal analysis
considerations and motivates such techniques over cross-sectional methods
for longitudinal data despite the increase in computational costs.

The longitudinal thickness framework is available in script form
within the ANTs software library along with the requisite processing components
(cf Appendix).  All generated
data used for input, such as the ADNI template and tissue priors, are available
upon request.  As previously mentioned, we also make available the csv files
containing the regional thickness values for all three pipelines.
