Herein we detailed the ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness framework which
was designed to take advantage of longitudinal data acquisition protocols while
accounting for the various bias issues that have been associated with processing
such data.  Over 600 subjects from the well-known longitudinal ADNI-1 data set
with diagnoses distributed between cognitively normal, MCI, LMCI, and AD were
processed through the original ANTs cross-sectional framework [@Tustison:2014ab] and
two longitudinal variants.  One of the variants, Longitudinal-SST, is
similar to the FreeSurfer longitudinal stream in that each time-point image is
reoriented to an unbiased single-subject template for subsequent processing.
Longitudinal-native, in contrast, estimates cortical thickness in the native
space while also using tissue prior probabilities generated from the SST.  

Comparative assessment utilized LME models to determine the between-subject to
within-subject variance ratios over the 62 regions of the brain defined by the
DKT parcellation scheme where higher values indicate greater scientific
interpretability.  In these terms, Longitudinal-native was clearly the best
performer.  Longitudinal-SST outperformed Cross-sectional over the majority of
regions.  Regional disparities point to increases in both between-subject and
within-subject variances which might be an additional interpolation
artifact.  In other words, interpolation potentially has a systematic but regionally varying effect.
Investigation of this issue is the subject of future research.  

Additional assessments included similar variance quantification in the EC
and diagnostic prediction using extreme gradient boosting models.  The
former evaluation was motivated by the prominence of the EC as a biomarker
in AD progression whereas the latter coupled a simplistic assumption of AD
progression with modern machine learning techniques similar in spirit to what
we did in our previous work [@Tustison:2014ab].  Both assessments supported the
findings of the first assessment in demonstrating the superiority of
Longitudinal-native.  These findings promote longitudinal analysis
considerations and motivates such techniques over cross-sectional methods
for longitudinal data despite the increase in computational costs.

The longitudinal thickness framework is available in script form
within the ANTs software
library along with the requisite processing components.  All generated
data used for input, such as the ADNI template and tissue priors, are available
upon request.  As previously mentioned, we also make available the csv files
containing the regional thickness values for all three pipelines.
