## ADNI-1 imaging data

![Demographic breakdown of the number of ADNI-1 subjects by diagnosis i.e., normal,
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI),
and Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Within each panel we plot the number of subjects
(by gender) per visit---baseline ("bl") and $n$ months ("m$n$").](../Figures/demoPlot.png)

The strict protocol design, large-scale recruitment, and public availability of
the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) makes it
an ideal data set for evaluating the ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness pipeline.
An MP-RAGE [@Mugler:1990aa] sequence for 1.5 and 3.0 T was used to collect the data
at the scan sites.  Specific acquisition parameters for 1.5 T and 3.0 T magnets
are given in Table 1 of [@Jack:2008aa].  Originally, collection goals were
200 elderly cognitively normal subjects collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months;
400 MCI subjects at risk for AD conversion at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months; and
200 AD subjects at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months.

The ADNI-1 data was downloaded in May of 2014.  The data was first processed using
the ANTs cross-sectional cortical thickness pipeline [@Tustison:2014ab]
(4399 total images).  Data was then processed using the ANTs longitudinal
stream (described in the next section).  In the final set of csv files we only included
time points for which clinical scores (e.g., MMSE) were available.  In total,
we included 186 elderly cognitive normals, 178 MCI subjects, 128 LMCI subjects,
and 123 AD subjects.  A further breakdown of demographic information is given
in Figure X.  Similarly, in Figure X, we show the 2-D distribution of Age vs. mini-mental
examination (MMSE) scores taken at the month 12 visit across diagnoses for the subjects
analyzed.
