# Introduction

Quantification of brain morphology is invaluable for studying a wide range of
neurological conditions with structural correlates (e.g.,
Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia [@du2007;@dickerson2009],
Parkinson's disease [@jubault2011],
Williams syndrome [@thompson2005],
multiple sclerosis [@ramasamy2009],
autism [@chung2005,@hardan2006],
migraines [@dasilva2007],
chronic smoking [@kuhn2010],
alcoholism [@fortier2011],
cocaine addiction [@makris2008],
schizophrenia [@nesvag2008],
bipolar disorder [@lyoo2006],
autism [@chung2005,@hardan2006],
marijuana use in adolescents [@Jacobus:2015aa],
Tourette syndrome in children [@sowell2008],
scoliosis in female adolescents [@wang2012],
heart failure [@Kumar:2015aa],
early-onset blindness [@jiang2009],
chronic pancreatitis [@frokjaer2012],
obsessive-compulsive disorder [@shin2007],
ADHD [@almeida-montes2012],
obesity [@raji2010],
heritable [@peterson2009] and elderly [@ballmaier2004] depression,
age [@kochunov2011],
gender [@luders2006a],
untreated male-to-female transsexuality [@luders2012],
handedness
[@luders2006,amunts2007],
intelligence [@shaw2006],
athletic ability [@wei2011],
meditative practices [@lazar2005],
musical ability [@bermudez2009;@foster2010],
musical instrument playing [@Hudziak:2014aa],
tendency toward criminality [@raine2011],
childhood sexual abuse in adult females [@heim2013],
and Tetris-playing ability in female adolescents [@haier2009]).
Essential for thickness quantification are the
many computational techniques which have been developed
to provide accurate measurements of the cerebral cortex.
These include various mesh-based
(e.g., [@macdonald2000;@magnotta1999;@kim2005]) and
volumetric techniques
(e.g., [@zeng1999;@jones2000;@das2009;@clement-vachet2011]).
Of noted significance, and representing the former,
is the well-known and highly utilized FreeSurfer
software package [@dale1999;@fischl1999;@fischl2000;@fischl2002;@fischl2004].

In inferring developmental processes, many of these studies employ
cross-sectional population sampling strategies despite the potential for
confounding effects [@Kraemer:2000aa].  Large-scale longitudinal studies,
such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [@Weiner2012],
mitigate some of the relevant statistical issues.  Similarly, much
research has been devoted to exploring methodologies for longitudinal
data processing.  Issues of normalization reference coordinate systems
and the potential for bias are discussed in [@Yushkevich:2010aa].  Briefly,
interpolation-induced artifacts can artificially inflate effect size.  Orientation
bias






In [@Tustison:2014ab], we introduced the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical
thickness framework which leverages various pre-processing, registration, segmentation,
and other image analysis tools that members of the ANTs and Insight Toolkit (ITK)
communities have developed over the years and disseminated as open-source.[^1]  In
this previously published work we processed a cohort
comprising four publicly available data sets totaling over 1200 subjects.
We used the derived thickness measurements to predict common
demographic outcomes (i.e., age, gender) which compared favorably with predictions
based on the corresponding FreeSurfer quantities.
This proposed ANTs-based pipeline has since been directed at a variety of neuroimaging
topics including mild cognitive impairment and depression [@Fujishima:2014aa],
short term memory in mild cognitive impairment [@Das:2016aa], and aphasia [@Olm:2016aa].

In this work, we introduce the ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness
pipeline and apply it to the entire ADNI1 data set.
