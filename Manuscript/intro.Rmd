# Introduction

Quantification of brain morphology significantly facilitates the
investigation of a wide range of neurological conditions with structural
correlates, including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s
disease [@du2007;@dickerson2009].  Essential for thickness quantification are the
many computational techniques which have been developed
to provide accurate measurements of the cerebral cortex.
These include various mesh-based
(e.g., [@macdonald2000;@magnotta1999;@kim2005]) and
volumetric techniques
(e.g., [@zeng1999;@jones2000;@das2009;@clement-vachet2011]).
Of noted significance, and representing the former,
is the well-known and highly utilized FreeSurfer
software package [@dale1999;@fischl1999;@fischl2000;@fischl2002;@fischl2004].

In inferring developmental processes, many studies employ
cross-sectional population sampling strategies despite the potential for
confounding effects [@Kraemer:2000aa].  Large-scale studies involving longitudinal
image acquisition of a targeted subject population, such as the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [@Weiner2012],
are designed to mitigate some of the relevant statistical issues.  Analogously, much
research has been devoted to exploring methodologies for properly exploiting such
studies and avoiding various forms of processing bias [@Reuter:2012aa].  For example,
FSL's SIENA (Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy) framework
[@Smith:2002aa] for detecting atrophy between longitudinal image pairs avoids a specific type
of processing bias by transforming the images to a midspace position between the two
time points.
As the authors point out "[i]n this way both images are subjected to a similar degree
of interpolation-related blurring."  Consequences of this "interpolation-related
blurring" were formally analyzed in [@Yushkevich:2010aa] in the context of
hippocampal volumetric change where it was shown that interpolation-induced
artifacts can artificially create and/or inflate effect size [@Thompson:2011aa].  These insights
and others have since been used for making specific recommendations with respect to longitudinal
image data processing [@Avants:2010ab;@Fox:2011aa;@Reuter:2012aa;@Hua:2013aa].

In [@Reuter:2011aa;@Reuter:2012aa], the authors
motivated the design and implementation of the longitudinal FreeSurfer variant
inspired by these earlier insights and the overarching general principle
of "treat[ing] all time points exactly the same."  It has
since been augmented by integrated linear mixed effects modeling capabilities
[@Bernal-Rusiel:2013aa] and has been used in a variety of studies including pediatric
cortical development [@Wierenga:2014aa], differential development in Alzheimer's
disease and fronto-temporal dementia [@Landin-Romero:2016aa], and fatigue in the
context of multiple sclerosis [@Nourbakhsh:2016aa].

We introduced the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical
thickness framework in [@Tustison:2014ab] which leverages various pre-processing, registration, segmentation,
and other image analysis tools that members of the ANTs and Insight Toolkit (ITK)
open-source communities have developed over the years and disseminated publicly [@ants].
This proposed ANTs-based pipeline has since been directed at a variety of neuroimaging
research topics including mild cognitive impairment and depression [@Fujishima:2014aa],
short term memory in mild cognitive impairment [@Das:2016aa], and aphasia [@Olm:2016aa].
Other authors extended the general framework to non-human studies [@PaganiDamianoGalbuseraEtAl2016;@MajkaChaplinYuEtAl2016].

In this work, we introduce the longitudinal version of the ANTs cortical thickness
pipeline and demonstrate its utility on the publicly available ADNI-1 data set.
In addition, we demonstrate that certain longitudinal processing choices have significant impact
on measurement quality in terms of within-subject and between-subject variances which,
in turn, heavily impacts the scientific interpretability of results.  Similar to
\textcolor{red}{previously outlined} research illustrating the negative impact of
interpolation effects on study results,
we show that the common practice of reorienting individual time point images to a
single-subject template for unbiased processing induces interpolation artifacts
which guides processing choices for the proposed ANTs longitudinal pipeline.
These choices for the ADNI-1 data produce tighter confidence intervals
in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals,
and less varied confidence/credible intervals for discerning cross-sectional effects.

<!--
To explore these findings in a more clinically oriented context, we also
use a machine learning-based training/prediction paradigm which demonstrates that
the recommended longitudinal processing approach leads to improved predictive diagnostic
accuracy over the alternative strategies, including cross-sectional processing.
