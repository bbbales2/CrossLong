# Introduction

Quantification of brain morphology significantly facilitates the investigation of
a wide range of neurological conditions with structural correlates (e.g.,
Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia [@du2007;@dickerson2009],
Parkinson's disease [@jubault2011],
Williams syndrome [@thompson2005],
multiple sclerosis [@ramasamy2009],
autism [@chung2005,@hardan2006],
migraines [@dasilva2007],
chronic smoking [@kuhn2010],
alcoholism [@fortier2011],
cocaine addiction [@makris2008],
schizophrenia [@nesvag2008],
bipolar disorder [@lyoo2006],
autism [@chung2005,@hardan2006],
marijuana use in adolescents [@Jacobus:2015aa],
Tourette syndrome in children [@sowell2008],
scoliosis in female adolescents [@wang2012],
heart failure [@Kumar:2015aa],
early-onset blindness [@jiang2009],
chronic pancreatitis [@frokjaer2012],
obsessive-compulsive disorder [@shin2007],
ADHD [@almeida-montes2012],
obesity [@raji2010],
heritable [@peterson2009] and elderly [@ballmaier2004] depression,
age [@kochunov2011],
gender [@luders2006a],
untreated male-to-female transsexuality [@luders2012],
handedness
[@luders2006,amunts2007],
intelligence [@shaw2006],
athletic ability [@wei2011],
meditative practices [@lazar2005],
musical ability [@bermudez2009;@foster2010],
musical instrument playing [@Hudziak:2014aa],
tendency toward criminality [@raine2011],
childhood sexual abuse in adult females [@heim2013],
and Tetris-playing ability in female adolescents [@haier2009]).
Essential for thickness quantification are the
many computational techniques which have been developed
to provide accurate measurements of the cerebral cortex.
These include various mesh-based
(e.g., [@macdonald2000;@magnotta1999;@kim2005]) and
volumetric techniques
(e.g., [@zeng1999;@jones2000;@das2009;@clement-vachet2011]).
Of noted significance, and representing the former,
is the well-known and highly utilized FreeSurfer
software package [@dale1999;@fischl1999;@fischl2000;@fischl2002;@fischl2004].

In inferring developmental processes, many of these studies employ
cross-sectional population sampling strategies despite the potential for
confounding effects [@Kraemer:2000aa].  Large-scale studies involving longitudinal
image acquisition of a targeted subject population, such as the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [@Weiner2012],
are designed to mitigate some of the relevant statistical issues.  Analogously, much
research has been devoted to exploring methodologies for properly exploiting such
studies and avoiding various forms of processing bias [@Reuter:2012aa].  For example,
FSL's SIENA (Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy) framework
[@Smith:2002aa] for detecting atrophy between two time points avoids a specific type
of processing bias by transforming the images to a midspace position between the two
time points.
As the authors point out "In this way both images are subjected to a similar degree
of interpolation-related blurring."  Consequences of this "interpolation-related
blurring" were formally analyzed in [@Yushkevich:2010aa] in the context of
hippocampal volumetric change where it was shown that interpolation-induced
artifacts can artificially inflate effect size [@Thompson:2011aa].  These insights
have since been used for making specific recommendations with respect to longitudinal
image data processing [@Fox:2011aa;@Reuter:2012aa;@Hua:2013aa].

In a series of papers [@Reuter:2011aa;@Reuter:2012aa] the authors
motivated the design and implementation of the longitudinal FreeSurfer variant partly
inspired by these earlier insights and encapsulated by the overarching heuristic
of "treat[ing] all time points exactly the same."  It has
since been augmented by integrated linear mixed effects modeling capabilities
[@Bernal-Rusiel:2013aa] and has been used in a variety of studies including pediatric
cortical development [@Wierenga:2014aa], differential development in Alzheimer's
disease and fronto-temporal dementia [@Landin-Romero:2016aa], and fatigue in the
context of multiple sclerosis [@Nourbakhsh:2016aa].

In [@Tustison:2014ab], we introduced the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical
thickness framework which leverages various pre-processing, registration, segmentation,
and other image analysis tools that members of the ANTs and Insight Toolkit (ITK)
open-source communities have developed over the years and disseminated publicly.[^1]
This proposed ANTs-based pipeline has since been directed at a variety of neuroimaging
research topics including mild cognitive impairment and depression [@Fujishima:2014aa],
short term memory in mild cognitive impairment [@Das:2016aa], and aphasia [@Olm:2016aa].
In this work, we introduce the longitudinal version of the ANTs cortical thickness
pipeline and demonstrate its utility on the publicly available ADNI-1 data set.  

We demonstrate that certain longitudinal processing choices have significant impact
on measurement quality in terms of within-subject and between subject variances which,
in turn, heavily impacts the scientifically interpretability of results.  Similar to
other research illustrating the negative impact of interpolation effects on study results,
we show that a common practice for unbiased processing induces a different set of
problematic artifacts which guides processing choices for the proposed ANTs pipeline.  In
addition, these choices for the ADNI-1 data produce tighter confidence intervals
in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals,
and less varied confidence/credible intervals for discerning cross-sectional effects.
