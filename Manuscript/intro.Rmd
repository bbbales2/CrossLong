# Introduction

Quantification of brain morphology has proven invaluable in studying conditional
abnormalities such as Huntington's disease [@rosas2002;@rosas2005;@selemon2004],
schizophrenia [@nesvag2008], bipolar disorder [@lyoo2006],
Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia [@du2007,@dickerson2009],
Parkinson's disease [@jubault2011], Williams syndrome [@thompson2005],
multiple sclerosis [@ramasamy2009], autism [@chung2005,@hardan2006],
migraines [@dasilva2007], chronic smoking [@kuhn2010], alcoholism [@fortier2011],
cocaine addiction [@makris2008], marijuana use in adolescents [@Jacobus:2015aa],
Tourette syndrome in children [@sowell2008],
scoliosis in female adolescents [@wang2012],
heart failure [@Kumar:2015aa],
early-onset blindness [@jiang2009],
chronic pancreatitis [@frokjaer2012],
obsessive-compulsive disorder [@shin2007], ADHD [@almeida-montes2012], obesity [@raji2010],
and heritable [@peterson2009]
and elderly [@ballmaier2004] depression.  Evidence of cortical thickness
variation has also been found to be a function of age [@kochunov2011],
gender [@luders2006a], untreated
male-to-female transsexuality [@luders2012],  handedness
[@luders2006,amunts2007], intelligence [@shaw2006], athletic
ability [@wei2011], meditative practices [@lazar2005], musical ability [@bermudez2009,@foster2010],
musical instrument playing [@Hudziak:2014aa],
tendency toward criminality [@raine2011],
childhood sexual abuse in adult females [@heim2013],
and Tetris-playing
ability in female adolescents [@haier2009].  Additionally,
connectivity studies demonstrate structural
relationships using cortical thickness measures
[@worsley2005,lerch2006,he2007,chen2008].

Large neuroimaging datasets such as those provided by the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are increasing the importance
of fully automated and multiple modality brain mapping tools
[@Weiner2012].  The scale of such datasets will only increase over
time as international projects continue to build
large-scale neuroimaging data resources.  Currently, the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) also mandates that any NIH-funded data
resources, including MRI, must be released to the public.  In contrast
to ADNI, which provides standardized data acquisition protocols used
across all sites, these smaller-scale projects are collected in an
unstructured way.  Therefore, neuroimage processing tools must
reliably quantify even when there is a relative lack of quality
control over the input data.  While robustness is a goal shared by all
software development targeted at neuroscience, very few methods have
been thoroughly tested on large and unstructured neuroimaging datasets.
