An equation:

$$ F_1 =  \frac{ 2 \cdot TP }{ 2 \cdot TP + FP + FN}. $$

Here is an example footnote.[^1]

[^1]: \textcolor{blue}{For comparison, the training data set of
the MS Lesion Segmentation challenge
associated with the international MICCAI 2008 conference has a mean lesion load of
204 ($\pm$ 752) mm$^3$ per lesion and the resolution is almost twice what is used
in this study (i.e., 0.5 $\times$ 0.5 $\times$ 0.5).}
