### Cross-sectional processing

In [@Tustison:2014ab] we introduced the ANTs cortical thickness processing
pipeline using a large cohort of $\sim$ 1200 images taken from four popular, publicly
available data sets with ages ranging from 4 to 97 years.  The processing pipeline
comprises the following four major steps:

* N4 bias correction [@Tustison:2010ac],
* skull stripping [@avants2010a],
* $n$-tissue segmentation [@Avants:2011aa], and
* cortical thickness estimation [@das2009]

which is enhanced by the use of optimal shape and intensity templates derived
from the specific populations of study.  Regional statistics were quantified by
parcellating the cortex using a collection of 20 atlases which were labeled using
the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) protocol [@Klein:2012aa] consisting of
31 labels per hemisphere (see Table 1).  Consensus labelings
in each subject were generated from the joint-label fusion approach of [@Wang:2013ab].
An thickness-based evaluation with the well-known FreeSurfer algorithm demonstrated
better predictive performance of age and gender.  Since the original publication, we
have added the optional inclusion of patch-based denoising based on an ANTs implementation
of the patch-based denoising algorithm of [@Manjon:2010aa].
The resulting regional statistics (including cortical thickness, surface area [@Lehmann:2012aa],
volumes, and Jacobian determinant values) were posted online
(https://github.com/ntustison/KapowskiChronicles).  These include the corresponding
FreeSurfer measurements which are also available for public consumption [@Hasan:2016aa].
Since publication, this pipeline has been used in a number of cross-sectional studies
[@Price:2015aa;@Wisse:2015aa;@Betancourt:2015aa].

### Longitudinal processing

The ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness pipeline extends the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline
to unbiased longitudinal studies. The pipeline first creates a shape and appearance average
subject-specific template (SST) for each individual.  It then rigidly aligns each time point to the SST to reduce the
effect of coordinate system or interpolation bias.  Subsequent processing segments
the SST into six probabilistic tissues classes:   cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), deep gray matter (striatum + thalamus),
brain stem, and cerebellum.  This requires processing the SST through two parallel workflows.  First,
the SST proceeds through the standard ANTs cortical thickness pipeline which generates
a brain extraction mask and the CSF posterior probability map.  Second, using
a data set of expert annotations [@Klein:2012aa], a class-leading multi-atlas joint label fusion step [@Wang:2013ab] is performed to
create individualized probability maps for all tissue types.  This final version of the SST enables
unbiased mappings to the group template, subject-specific tissue segmentations, region of interest volumes and
cortical thickness maps for each of the original time series images.
The corresponding cortical labelings (generated
using a multi-atlas label fusion approach and a selected cortical parcellation protocol)
are then used to tabulate regional thickness and area values for statistical analysis.
Other modalities are then mapped to the group template through these unbiased
transformations, as in [@Tustison:2014aa;@Avants:2015aa]

![The ANTs longitudinal cortical thickness pipeline.  The original T1-weighted images
are used to generate an unbiased single-subject template (SST).  The SST is then
processed via the segmentation portion of the ANTs cross-sectional cortical thickness
pipeline reported in [@Tustison:2014aa] using the group template and tissue priors.
This results in a probabilistic estimate of the
CSF and the brain mask.  Joint label fusion (JLF) of 20 atlases involving six labels (CSF, gray
matter, white matter, deep gray matter, brain stem, and cerebellum) is used to get a
probabilistic estimate of the six tissues.  The latter five JLF probabilistic tissue
estimates are used as the SST prior probabilities whereas the CSF SST prior probablity
is derived as a combination of the JLF and segmentation CSF estimates, i.e.,
$P(CSF) = \max\left( P_{Seg}(CSF), P_{JLF}(CSF) \right)$.  The T1-weighted image at each
time point is rigidly aligned to the template and processed through original cortical
thickness pipeline using the SST template and auxiliary images
(brain extraction mask and tissue priors).  Cortical labelings obtained using JLF are
then used to quantify ROI-based statistics.](../Figures/longitudinalPipeline.png)

minimizing malf-labeling. We should also discuss the ants implementation (multi-threading,
etc.)}__
