# Results

All imaging data were processed through the five processing streams
(i.e., FS Cross, FS Long, ANTs Cross, ANTs SST, and ANTs Native)
on the high performance computing cluster  at the University of California, 
Irvine (UCI).  Based on the evaluation design described in the previous section, 
we compare pipeline performance when applied to the ADNI-1 data.
\textcolor{blue}{
Specifically, we calculate the variance ratios, described in Section 2.5,
for each of the 62 DKT regions for each of the five pipelines.  These are
compared and discussed.  We then explore how this general criterion for
evaluating measurement quality applies specifically to a longitudinal analysis of 
the ADNI-1 data in discriminating the diagnostic stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

\textcolor{blue}{
After processing the image data through the various pipelines, we tabulated 
the regional thickness values and made them available as .csv 
files online in the corresonding GitHub repository }[@crossLong].
\textcolor{blue}{
We also provide the Perl scripts used to run the pipelines on the UCI cluster
and the R scripts used to do the analysis below.  Additional figures and plots
have also been created which were not included in this work.  For example, 
spaghetti plots showing absolute thickness and longitudinal thickness changes are 
contained in the 
subdirectory CrossLong/Data/RegionalThicknessSpaghettiPlots/.

## Cortical residual and between-subject thickness variability

SST method dominates the others across the majority of
regions---its point estimates (posterior medians) are greater than those of the other
processing methods except for the left and right EC values in
FreeSurfer Long (although there is significant overlap in the credible intervals
in those regions).
These results also suggest that longitudinal processing is to be
preferred for both packages.}

\end{figure}

The LME model defined in (\ref{eq::lme1}) was used to quantify the between-subject
and residual variance with the expectation that maximizing the former while minimizing
the latter optimizes measurement quality in terms of prediction and confidence intervals.
Figure \ref{fig:ratios} provides the resulting 95\% credible intervals
for the distributions of region-specific variance ratios $r^k = \tau_k / \sigma_k$
for each of the five pipelines.  Based on the discussion in the previous section, 
superior methododologies are designated by larger variance ratios.

between subject variability, and ratio of the between-subject variability and

``better'' measurement maximizes this latter ratio.}
\label{fig:variance_boxplots}
\end{figure}

ANTs SST has the highest ratio variance across most of the 62 regions over the
other methods.  It rarely overlaps with ANTs Native and never with
ANTs Cross.  In contrast to the majority of FreeSurfer regional ratio variances (from
both FS Cross and FS Long) which are smaller than those of the ANTs pipelines,
FS Long has larger ratio values for the EC region with the only overlap in the
credible intervals with ANTs SST.

\end{figure}

The plot in
Figure \ref{fig:variance_boxplots} shows a relative summary of all the regional quantities
for all three variance measurements (residual, between-subject, and variance
ratio) via box plots.  These relative distributions show
that both between-subject and residual quantities contribute to the disparities
in the ratio evaluation metric.  Finally, we overlay the variance ratio values on the
corresponding regions of a 3-D rendering of the ADNI template (Figure \ref{fig:brain_variance})
to provide an additional visual comparison between the methods.

<!--
Therefore, Figures \ref{fig:ratios}, \ref{fig:variance_boxplots}, and \ref{fig:brain_variance}
may be considered as evidence for ANTs SST providing higher quality data than
those provided by the other methods.

pipelines trend towards a lower relative mean squared prediction error.

## Regional diagnostic contrasts based on cortical atrophy


\textcolor{blue}{The variance ratio explored in the previous section is a 
generic desideratum for statistical assessment of performance over the 
set of possible use cases.  In this section, we narrow the focus to the 
unique demographical characteristics of the ADNI-1 study data and look 
at performance of the various pipelines in distinguishing between diagnostic 
subgroups on a region-by-region basis.  Previous work has explored
various aspects of Alzheimer's disease with respect to its spatial distribution
and the regional onset of cerebral atrophy.  For example, although much 
work points to the entrohinal cortex as the site for initial deposition of
amyloid and tau} [@Yassa:2014aa]\textcolor{blue}{, other evidence points to the
basal forebrain as preceding cortical spread} [@Schmitz:2016aa]\textcolor{blue}{.  Other 
considerations include the use of hippocampal atrophy rates
as an image-based biomarker of cognitive decline} [@Andrews:2016aa]\textcolor{blue}{, 
differentiation from other dementia manifestations (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy} 
[@Crutch:2017aa]\textcolor{blue}{), 
and the use of FreeSurfer for monitoring disease progression} [@Falahati:2017aa]\textcolor{blue}{.
Thus, longitudinal measurements have immediate application in Alzheimer's disease
research.  To showcase the utility of the ANTs framework, we compare the 
generated longitudinal measurements and their ability to differentiate diagnostic
subgroups (i.e., CN vs. LMCI vs. AD).}

\textcolor{blue}{Pipeline-specific linear mixed-effects models were constructed for each DKT region
relating the change in cortical thickness to diagnosis and other pertinent covariates.  
In the notation of} [@wilkinson1973]\textcolor{blue}{), regional LME models are defined
as:}

\begin{align}
\Delta Y^k & \sim Y_{bl}^k + AGE_{bl} + ICV_{bl} + APOE + GENDER \nonumber \\
           & + DIAGNOSIS + VISIT:DIAGNOSIS + ( 1 | ID ) + ( 1 | SITE )      
\end{align}

\textcolor{blue}{
where $\Delta Y^k$ is the change in thickness of the $k^{th}$ DKT region from 
baseline (bl) thickness measurement $Y^k_{bl}$.  We also include random
intercepts for both the individual subject (ID) and the acquisition site.
Modeling was performed in R using the {\tt lme4} package}
[@JSSv067i01] 
\textcolor{blue}{followed
by Tukey post-hoc analyses to test 
the significance of the ``LMCI$-$CN'', ``AD$-$LMCI'', and ``AD$-$CN'' diagnostic contrasts.

The variance ratio is a generic desideratum for any statistical assessment
of performance over the set of possible use cases.  Here we demonstrate two such possibilities
involving prediction performance over the three longitudinal-specific cortical 
thickness pipelines:  FSLong, ANTsNative, and ANTsSST.  After estimating the 
regional cortical atrophy rates derived from the LME-derived slopes for each subject of each 
pipeline, we use those slope values to predict age and change in MMSE scores (cf Figure 
\ref{fig:mmsePrediction}) for certain
cortical regions. We predict age for the regions selected in
[@Tustison:2014ab] 
(i.e., both left and right hemispheres for the pars opercularis (pOPER), 
pars triangularis (pTRI), posterior cingulate (PCC), precentral (PreC), and tranverse temporal (TT) 
cortical regions)
since they demonstrated the largest age effects between both the FreeSurfer
and ANTs cross-sectional results although, in this case, we are using rates of
atrophy vs. actual thickness values for age prediction.  Specifically, we test 
the linear model 
\begin{equation}
Age_i \sim \Delta Y_i^k + Diagnosis_i + APOE_i + ICV_i + Gender_i 
\end{equation}
where $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ subject, $\Delta Y_i^k$ is the atrophy rate for the $i^{th}$ subject
in the $k^{th}$ region of interest where the model is trained on 90\% of the cohort and 
tested on the remaining 10\%.  This training/prediction scenario is repeated 100 times per region
where the assignment to training or prediction data subsets is shuffled each time.
The results of this predictive evaluation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:agePrediction}.
ANTs-based lower mean squared predictive error (MSE) is consistent with corresponding variance ratios.
}


Figures \ref{fig:variance_boxplots} and \ref{fig:brain_variance} present
lower variance ratios for ANTsSST and ANTsNative in most regions except 
for the left and entorhinal cortex
where corresponding FSLong values are slightly higher.  The characteristics of the ADNI 
population and the prominent role of the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions for AD pathology indication
[@Yassa:2014aa] is used to show that
the slightly higher variance ratio of FSLong translates to relatively superior
change in MMSE (from baseline to 24 months) prediction performance. Thus, we evaluate 
the variance ratio in the context of the linear model 
\begin{equation}
\Delta MMSE_i \sim \Delta Y_i^k + Age_i + APOE_i + ICV_i + Gender_i
\end{equation}
where $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ subject, $\Delta Y_i^k$ is the atrophy rate for the $i^{th}$ subject
in the $k^{th}$ region of interest.  This MMSE prediction model is evaluated similarly to that used 
for age prediction.
