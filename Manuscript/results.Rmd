## Comparison of ANTs cortical thickness pipelines

As described previously, we employ a number of criteria to evaluate the performance
of the ANTs cortical thickness longitudinal pipeline  with the original cross-sectional
workflow described previously [@Tustison:2014ab].  Further, we look at two variants
of the longitudinal pipeline:  the first where each time point image is reoriented to the
SST prior to segmentation and cortical thickness estimation (denoted as "longitudinal 1")
and the second where each time point is processed in native space (denoted as
 "longitudinal 2").  

 _Within-subject/between-subject variability_

Maximizing the between-subject variability while simultaneously minimizing the
within-subject variability minimizes the overlap between groups implying a more
significant effect of the condition separating the groups.  In Figure X, we provide
a general overview of how each of these three measurements compare across
the three different ANTs pipeline variants over the 62 DKT regions.  This illustrates
the superiority of the longitudinal 2 pipeline where processing occurs in native
space.  It is also interesting to note that longitudinal 1 is an improvement over
the cross-sectional processing in that, overall, it reduces both types of variability.

within-subject variability for each of the 62 DKT regions.  Note that the
"better" measurement maximizes this latter ratio.](../Figures/allData.png)

Further insights can be gleaned by looking at the ratio measurements per region
(see Figure X).  On a per region basis, longitudinal 2 outperforms both the cross-sectional
and longitudinal 1 pipelines.  Although longitudinal 1 is superior for the majority
of the DKT regions over cross-sectional processing, exceptions include the
left and right entorhinal,
left and right fusiform,
left and right inferior temporal,
left and right paracentral,
left and right parahippocampal,
left and right rosterior anterior cingulate,
left lateral orbitofrontal,
left medial orbitofrontal,
left pars triangularis,
right cuneus,
right insula,
right isthmus cingulate,
right pericalcarine,
right posterior cingulate
right precentral,
right postcentral, and
right transverse temporal.

_Interpolation effects associated with longitudinal 1 processing_

The subset of regions where the longitudinal 1 $<$ cross-sectional in terms of
the variance ratio caused us to investigate this issue further.  Considering the
only difference between longitudinal 1 and longitudinal 2 is the reorientation
to the SST, our exploration focused on the effects of interpolation. Specifically,
we suspected that interpolation artificially changes the anatomy (i.e., volume
and surface area) which results in additive  noise to the thickness measurements
and that this effect varies spatially.  To test this, we used the 20 DKT atlases
[@klein2012] which were sampled from the OASIS data set.  An optimal mean/shape
template [@Avants:2010aa] was created from this cohort to which each T1-weighted
image was rigidly registered.  Using the resulting rigid transform, the label
map of 62 regions was warped to the space of the template (similar in spirit to
the protocol characterizing longitudinal 1) using nearest neighbor interpolation
(check on this).  Calculation of the volumes (by summing up the volume of each
voxel) and surface areas (using a well-performing digitally-based surface estimator
[@Lehmann:2012aa]) for each of the 62 regions were calculated both before and after
transformation to the template.  We then computed the percent change for each
of the two anatomical measures and correlated those with the per subject variability
which is plotted in Figure X.
