Pipeline-specific LME models were used to compute the slope values for each DKT region
describing the change in cortical thickness.  These slope values were used to test 
differentiation between diagnoses (i.e., CN vs. LMCI vs. AD) to illustrate the feasibility 
of the measurements based on known general trends of
varying cortical atrophy rates in the ADNI population} [@Leung:2013aa]\textcolor{blue}{.  
In Tables \ref{tab:leftaov} and \ref{tab:rightaov} we show the 95\% confidence intervals

adjusted statistical significance using Tukey's honest significant difference test.  
All pipelines demonstrate differentiating capabilities

## Cortical residual and between-subject thickness variability

\caption{95\% credible intervals of the region-specific variance ratios

Longitudinal-native method dominates the others \textcolor{black}{across the majority of
regions}: its point estimates (posterior medians) are greater than those of the other
processing methods \textcolor{black}{except for the left and right EC values in
FreeSurfer Long (although there is significant overlap in the credible intervals
in those regions)}.  
These results also suggest that \textcolor{black}{longitudinal processing is to be
preferred for both packages.}}
\label{fig:ratios}
\end{figure}

The LME model defined in (\ref{eq::lme1}) was used to quantify the between-subject
and residual variance with the expectation that maximizing the former while minimizing
the latter optimizes measurement quality in terms of prediction and confidence intervals.
Figure \ref{fig:ratios} provides the resulting 95\% credible intervals
for the distributions of region-specific variance ratios $r^k = \tau_k / \sigma_k$
for each of the five pipelines.  The superior method is designated by larger variance ratios and has
the greater discriminative capacity for the data corresponding to that processing method.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/allData_FINALX.png}
\caption{Box plots showing the distribution of the residual variability,
between subject variability, and ratio of the between-subject variability and
residual variability for each of the 62 DKT regions.  Note that the
``better'' measurement maximizes this latter ratio.}
\label{fig:variance_boxplots}
\end{figure}

ANTs SST has the highest ratio variance across most of the 62 regions over the
other methods.  It rarely overlaps with ANTs Native and never with
ANTs Cross.  \textcolor{black}{
In contrast to the majority of FreeSurfer regional ratio variances (from
both FS Cross and FS Long) which are smaller than those of the ANTs pipelines,
FS Long has larger ratio values for the EC region with the only overlap in the
credible intervals with ANTs SST.}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/medianRatios3D.png}
\caption{3-D volumetric rendering of the regional variance ratio values on the generated ADNI template.
The higher variance ratios indicate greater between-subject to residual variability.}
\label{fig:brain_variance}
\end{figure}

The plot in
Figure \ref{fig:variance_boxplots} shows a relative summary of all the regional quantities
for all three variance measurements (residual, between-subject, and variance
ratio) via box plots.  These relative distributions show
that both between-subject and residual quantities contribute to the disparities
in the ratio evaluation metric.  Finally, we overlay the variance ratio values on the
corresponding regions of a 3-D rendering of the ADNI template (Figure \ref{fig:brain_variance})
to provide an additional visual comparison between the methods.
Therefore, Figures \ref{fig:ratios}, \ref{fig:variance_boxplots}, and \ref{fig:brain_variance}
may be considered as evidence for ANTs SST providing higher quality data than
those provided by the other methods.

pipelines trend towards a lower relative mean squared prediction error. }

\textcolor{blue}{
The variance ratio is a generic desideratum for any statistical assessment
of performance over the set of possible use cases.  Here we demonstrate two such possibilities
involving prediction performance over the three longitudinal-specific cortical 
thickness pipelines:  FSLong, ANTsNative, and ANTsSST.  After estimating the 
regional cortical atrophy rates derived from the LME-derived slopes for each subject of each 
pipeline, we use those slope values to predict age and change in MMSE scores (cf Figure 
\ref{fig:mmsePrediction}) for certain
cortical regions. We predict age for the regions selected in}
[@Tustison:2014ab] \textcolor{blue}{
(i.e., both left and right hemispheres for the pars opercularis (pOPER), 
pars triangularis (pTRI), posterior cingulate (PCC), precentral (PreC), and tranverse temporal (TT) 
cortical regions)
since they demonstrated the largest age effects between both the FreeSurfer
and ANTs cross-sectional results although, in this case, we are using rates of
atrophy vs. actual thickness values for age prediction.  Specifically, we test 
the linear model 
\begin{equation}
Age_i \sim \Delta Y_i^k + Diagnosis_i + APOE_i + ICV_i + Gender_i 
\end{equation}
where $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ subject, $\Delta Y_i^k$ is the atrophy rate for the $i^{th}$ subject
in the $k^{th}$ region of interest where the model is trained on 90\% of the cohort and 
tested on the remaining 10\%.  This training/prediction scenario is repeated 100 times per region
where the assignment to training or prediction data subsets is shuffled each time.
The results of this predictive evaluation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:agePrediction}.
ANTs-based lower mean squared predictive error (MSE) is consistent with corresponding variance ratios.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
Figures \ref{fig:variance_boxplots} and \ref{fig:brain_variance} present
lower variance ratios for ANTsSST and ANTsNative in most regions except 
for the left and entorhinal cortex
where corresponding FSLong values are slightly higher.  The characteristics of the ADNI 
population and the prominent role of the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions for AD pathology indication}
[@Yassa:2014aa] \textcolor{blue}{is used to show that
the slightly higher variance ratio of FSLong translates to relatively superior
change in MMSE (from baseline to 24 months) prediction performance. Thus, we evaluate 
the variance ratio in the context of the linear model 
\begin{equation}
\Delta MMSE_i \sim \Delta Y_i^k + Age_i + APOE_i + ICV_i + Gender_i
\end{equation}
where $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ subject, $\Delta Y_i^k$ is the atrophy rate for the $i^{th}$ subject
in the $k^{th}$ region of interest.  This MMSE prediction model is evaluated similarly to that used 
for age prediction.

<!-- ### Case study: entorhinal cortical thickness variability -->

<!-- \input{ecStatisticalResults.tex} -->


<!-- Here we present results from the entorhinal cortical thickness case study (Section 2.3.2). -->
<!-- We demonstrate the way in which different arrangements of within-subject and -->
<!-- between-subject variability influence statistical inference and prediction.   -->
<!-- Data quality translates directly to quality of statistical results and the -->
<!-- scientific conclusions derived therefrom. Hence, data with good variance and -->
<!-- precision properties will benefit statistical analyses in multiple ways. To -->
<!-- demonstrate these benefits, we focus on data from the EC and -->
<!-- present three different aspects of variability and their statistical upshots. -->
<!-- Table \ref{table:res_tab} presents different aspects of model variability and shows -->
<!-- their relationships to uncertainty in prediction and estimation.  Model variability -->
<!-- is shown in terms of point estimates (posterior medians) for different functions -->
<!-- of the variance terms from Model \eqref{eq::lme1}.  Predictive and estimation -->
<!-- uncertainty takes the form of credible interval widths and predictive variance. -->
<!-- The larger these quantities, the more uncertainty, and hence the less definite -->
<!-- the scientific conclusions reached.  Both raw and normalized results are presented. -->
<!-- For each quantity, the cells corresponding to highest performance are colored green, -->
<!-- and those corresponding to worst performance are colored red. -->

<!-- On the left of Table \ref{table:res_tab}, the variance ratio is presented alongside -->
<!-- the width of the credible interval corresponding to the slope parameter $\beta$ -->
<!-- from Model \eqref{eq::lme1}. In general, a higher ratio of between-subject and -->
<!-- within-subject variances implies greater precision when estimating trends and -->
<!-- associations through time.  As expected from the previous results regarding the -->
<!-- ratio of between- and within-subject variability, ANTs Native -->
<!-- yields the smallest credible interval on the slope parameter. -->

<!-- In the middle of Table \ref{table:res_tab}, within-subject variability is presented -->
<!-- alongside predictive variance, i.e., the median for each subject-specific empirical -->
<!-- variance when predicting EC thickness 6 months out from the last observation. -->
<!-- As might be expected these two quantities track closely to each other, since prediction -->
<!-- variability is an amalgam of within-subject variability and uncertainty in model -->
<!-- parameters.  Again, the ANTs Native method performs best whereas ANTs SST performs worst. -->

<!-- \begin{figure}[ht!] -->
<!-- \centering -->
<!-- \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/results_plot_WithScr.png} -->
<!-- \caption{Aspects of model variance are compared with -->
<!-- credible interval sizes and variance in predictions for the ANTs-based -->
<!-- pipelines. Values are normalized by the -->
<!-- largest quantity, and processing methods are distinguished by color and ordering. -->
<!-- On the left, the variance ratio $r = \tau / \sigma$ is compared to the width of -->
<!-- credible interval for the slope term of Model \eqref{eq::lme1}. In the middle, -->
<!-- within-subject variance, $\sigma^2$, is compared to predictive variance.  On the -->
<!-- right, total variance, $\sigma^2 + \tau^2$, is compared to width of credible interval -->
<!-- for the cross-sectional association of AD status with EC thickness.}\label{fig1} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->


<!-- Finally, the right side of Table \ref{table:res_tab}, compares total variance to -->
<!-- the width of credible intervals pertaining to the cross-sectional association of -->
<!-- AD diagnosis and EC thickness as modeled in Equation \eqref{eq::slr}. -->
<!-- As total variance rises, so too does uncertainty in cross-sectional effects. -->
<!-- However, all three processing methods achieve roughly the same amount of total -->
<!-- variability, so no trend is visible.  It is interesting to observe that for this -->
<!-- particular example the lower bound of the second longitudinal is farther from the -->
<!-- null effect of zero when compared to the other two approaches. That is, despite -->
<!-- having marginally greater total variance, the distance from zero for the credible -->
<!-- interval corresponding to ANTs Native is 0.81, whereas the -->
<!-- distances for ANTs SST and ANTs Cross are 0.75 and -->
<!-- 0.70, respectively.  Figure \ref{fig1} displays the normalized results. -->
