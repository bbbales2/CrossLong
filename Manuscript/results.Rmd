# Results


Based on the evaluation design described in the previous section, we compare
the performance of the five processing approaches \textcolor{black}{(FS Cross, FS Long, ANTs Cross,
 ANTs SST, and ANTs native)} as applied to the ADNI-1 data.  Specifically, we demonstrate how the variance ratio
defined in Equation \eqref{eq::var_rat} illustrates ways in which different aspects of
variability affect confidence in prediction and estimation \textcolor{black}{for these different pipelines}.

### Cortical within-subject and between-subject thickness variability

processing methods \textcolor{black}{except for the left and right EC values in

Our first evaluation strategy was to use LME models to quantify the between-subject
and within-subject variance with the expectation that maximizing the former while minimizing
the latter optimizes measurement quality in terms of prediction and confidence intervals.
Figure \ref{fig:ratios} provides the resulting 95\% credible intervals
for the distributions of region-specific variance ratios $r^k = \tau_k / \sigma_k$
for each of the five pipelines.  The superior method is designated by larger variance ratios and has
the greater discriminative capacity for the data corresponding to that processing method.

``better'' measurement maximizes this latter ratio.}
\label{fig:variance_boxplots}
\end{figure}

ANTs Native has the highest ratio variance across most of the 62 regions over the
other methods.  It rarely overlaps with ANTs SST and never with
ANTs Cross.  \textcolor{black}{
In contrast to the majority of FreeSurfer regional ratio variances (from
both FS Cross and FS Long) which are smaller than those of the ANTs pipelines,
FS Long has larger ratio values for the EC region with the only overlap in the
credible intervals with ANTs Native.}

\caption{3-D volumetric rendering of the regional variance ratio values on the generated ADNI template.

\label{fig:brain_variance}
\end{figure}

The plot in
Figure \ref{fig:variance_boxplots} shows a relative summary of all the regional quantities
for all three variance measurements (within-subject, between-subject, and variance
ratio) via box plots.  These relative distributions show
that both between-subject and within-subject quantities contribute to the disparities
in the ratio evaluation metric.  Finally, we overlay the variance ratio values on the
corresponding regions of a 3-D rendering of the ADNI template (Figure \ref{fig:brain_variance})
to provide an additional visual comparison between the methods.
Therefore, Figures \ref{fig:ratios}, \ref{fig:variance_boxplots}, and \ref{fig:brain_variance}
may be considered as evidence for ANTs Native
providing higher quality data than
those provided by the other methods.   

### Case study: entorhinal cortical thickness variability

\input{ecStatisticalResults.tex}


Here we present results from the entorhinal cortical thickness case study (Section 2.3.2).
We demonstrate the way in which different arrangements of within-subject and
between-subject variability influence statistical inference and prediction.  
Data quality translates directly to quality of statistical results and the
scientific conclusions derived therefrom. Hence, data with good variance and
precision properties will benefit statistical analyses in multiple ways. To
demonstrate these benefits, we focus on data from the EC and
present three different aspects of variability and their statistical upshots.
Table \ref{table:res_tab} presents different aspects of model variability and shows
their relationships to uncertainty in prediction and estimation.  Model variability
is shown in terms of point estimates (posterior medians) for different functions
of the variance terms from Model \eqref{eq::lme1}.  Predictive and estimation
uncertainty takes the form of credible interval widths and predictive variance.
The larger these quantities, the more uncertainty, and hence the less definite
the scientific conclusions reached.  Both raw and normalized results are presented.
For each quantity, the cells corresponding to highest performance are colored green,
and those corresponding to worst performance are colored red.

On the left of Table \ref{table:res_tab}, the variance ratio is presented alongside
the width of the credible interval corresponding to the slope parameter $\beta$
from Model \eqref{eq::lme1}. In general, a higher ratio of between-subject and
within-subject variances implies greater precision when estimating trends and
associations through time.  As expected from the previous results regarding the
ratio of between- and within-subject variability, ANTs Native
yields the smallest credible interval on the slope parameter.

In the middle of Table \ref{table:res_tab}, within-subject variability is presented
alongside predictive variance, i.e., the median for each subject-specific empirical
variance when predicting EC thickness 6 months out from the last observation.
As might be expected these two quantities track closely to each other, since prediction
variability is an amalgam of within-subject variability and uncertainty in model
parameters.  Again, the ANTs Native method performs best whereas ANTs SST performs worst.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/results_plot_WithScr.png}
\caption{Aspects of model variance are compared with
credible interval sizes and variance in predictions for the ANTs-based
pipelines. Values are normalized by the
largest quantity, and processing methods are distinguished by color and ordering.
On the left, the variance ratio $r = \tau / \sigma$ is compared to the width of
credible interval for the slope term of Model \eqref{eq::lme1}. In the middle,
within-subject variance, $\sigma^2$, is compared to predictive variance.  On the
right, total variance, $\sigma^2 + \tau^2$, is compared to width of credible interval
for the cross-sectional association of AD status with EC thickness.}\label{fig1}
\end{figure}


Finally, the right side of Table \ref{table:res_tab}, compares total variance to
the width of credible intervals pertaining to the cross-sectional association of
AD diagnosis and EC thickness as modeled in Equation \eqref{eq::slr}.
As total variance rises, so too does uncertainty in cross-sectional effects.
However, all three processing methods achieve roughly the same amount of total
variability, so no trend is visible.  It is interesting to observe that for this
particular example the lower bound of the second longitudinal is farther from the
null effect of zero when compared to the other two approaches. That is, despite
having marginally greater total variance, the distance from zero for the credible
interval corresponding to ANTs Native is 0.81, whereas the
distances for ANTs SST and ANTs Cross are 0.75 and
0.70, respectively.  Figure \ref{fig1} displays the normalized results.

_Diagnostic prediction via extreme gradient boosting_

A clinically-based prediction strategy was performed to evaluate the quality
of the cortical thickness measurements produced by each method.  The rate of
thickness change determined over the set of subject imaging visits was used
as a feature set for predicting diagnosis.  The basic idea is that regional
thinning is accelerated in some regions versus others which should be reflected
in the assigned diagnostic category.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/accuracyBarPlot0.9.png}
\caption{Bar plot of the accuracy for each of the ANTs pipeline alternatives along with
the distribution summary produced from random guessing.  Accuracy was
 determined from the confusion matrices that were calculated for each of the
 1000 iterations.  Using Tukey multiple comparisons of means at a 95\% family-wise
 confidence level, the adjusted p-values were: Longitudinal-SST $-$ Cross-sectional $< 1e-4$,
 Longitudinal-native $-$ Cross-sectional $< 1e-6$, Longitudinal-native $-$ Longitudinal-SST $< 1e-6$.}
\label{fig:xgbDensity}
\end{figure}

Using the model described by Equation \eqref{eq::xgboost_model}, we compared
the classification capabilities of each of the three pipelines.  For each of
$N$ iterations, the data was randomly split 90/10 (i.e., 90\% training and 10\% testing)
and used to construct three diagnostic classification models from the training data,
one for each pipeline.  The testing data portion and the corresponding prediction
sets were used to construct confusion matrices from which diagnostic accuracy was
calculated.  Chosen XGBoost model parameters deviating from the default were:
number of trees = number of iterations ("nrounds") = 100 and
gradient step ("eta") = 0.3, based on parameter tuning on a small data subset over
all three pipelines.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=80mm]{../Figures/importanceCombinedLong20.9.png}
\caption{At each iteration of the extreme gradient
boosting optimization, the accuracy of the model is dependent on splitting
the current tree on a single feature to correct any remaining misclassifications.  
The improvement in accuracy derived from each feature split is quantified by the gain.
The gain measurements of the extreme gradient boosting models for the
ANTs longitudinal-native processing.  We average over all iterations and
each training/testing run to produce the mean value for each feature plotted above.
The bar and whiskers for each feature represents a single standard deviation
of the average gain over all the training/testing runs.
}
\label{fig:xgbGain}
\end{figure}

The resulting accuracy distribution summariess are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:xgbDensity} and
compared statistically using Tukey's range test which indicated increasing
performance Cross-sectional < Longitudinal-SST < Longitudinal-native.  These models
also provide means for assessing feature importance through the "gain" values.
The gain plot is given in Figure \ref{fig:xgbGain}.
The information offered by the gain plot is consistent with what we know about selective
vulnerability of brain regions to AD-related neurodegeneration [@dickerson2009].
For example, medial temporal regions such as the entorhinal and parahippocampal
cortices are near the top offering the most diagnostic information, whereas regions
such as paracentral cortices are near the bottom, offering very little diagnostic information.

_Interpolation effects associated with Longitudinal-SST processing_

[\textcolor{black}{Nick is working on this section.  Might not be included.}]

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/oasisCorrelationVolumeAndSurfaceArea.png}
\caption{The between-subject variability (left) and within-subject variability (right)
versus the volumetric (top) and surface area (bottom) measurements.
Note that each of these correlations are significant ($p < 0.001$)}
\label{fig:interp}
\end{figure}

The subset of regions where the Longitudinal-SST $<$ Cross-sectional in terms of
the variance ratio caused us to investigate this issue further.  Considering the
only difference between Longitudinal-SST and Longitudinal-native is the reorientation
to the SST, our exploration focused on the effects of interpolation. Specifically,
we suspected that interpolation artificially changes the anatomy (i.e., volume
and surface area) which results in additive  noise to the thickness measurements
and that this effect varies spatially.  To test this, we used the 20 DKT atlases
[@klein2012] which were sampled from the OASIS data set.  An optimal mean/shape
template [@Avants:2010aa] was created from this cohort to which each T1-weighted
image was rigidly registered.  Using the resulting rigid transform, the label
map of 62 regions was warped to the space of the template (similar in spirit to
the protocol characterizing Longitudinal-SST) using nearest neighbor
interpolation.  Calculation of the volumes (by summing up the volume of each
voxel) and surface areas (using a well-performing digitally-based surface estimator
[@Lehmann:2012aa]) for each of the 62 regions were calculated both before and after
transformation to the template.  We then computed the percent change for each
of the two anatomical measures and correlated those with the per subject variability
which is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:interp}.
