We used a simple statistical principle to compare performance between
cross-sectional and longitudinal processing methods.  We said that one
method outperforms the other when it does a better job minimizing
within-subject variability and maximizing between-subject variability in
cortical thickness measurements.  Such a quality implies greater
within-subject reproducibility while distinguishing between patient
subpopulations. As such this will amount to higher precision when
cortical thickness is used as a predictor variable or model covariate in
statistical analyses upstream. This criterion is immediately assessable
in terms of estimates associated to the longitudinal
mixed-effects model outlined below.

As previously noted we observed yearly cortical thickness measurements
from sixty-two separate regions of interest.  To assess the above
variance criterion while accounting for changes that may occur through
the passage of time, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model for parameter
estimation.  Let $Y^k_{ij}$ denote the $i^{th}$ individual's cortical
thickness measurement corresponding to the $k^{th}$ region of interest
at measurement $j$.  Under the Bayesian paradigm we utilized a model of
the form \begin{gather} Y^k_{ij} \sim N(\alpha^k_i + \beta^k t,
\sigma_k^2) \\ \nonumber \alpha^k_i \sim N(\alpha^k_0, \tau^2_k) \qquad
\alpha^k_0, \beta^k \sim N(0,10)  \qquad \sigma_k^2,  \tau_k^2 \sim
\mbox{Cauchy}^+ (0, 5) \end{gather} Specification of parameters in the
above prior distributions reflect commonly accepted diffuse priors.
$\tau^2_k$ represents the between-subject variance parameter, and
$\sigma^2_k$ represents the within-subject variance parameter.  For each
region, the quantity of interest is thus the ratio $r^k =
\frac{\tau^2_k}{\sigma^2_k}$.  This ratio is closely related to the
intraclass correlation coefficient [@bartko1976various].  The posterior distribution of
$r^k$ was summarized via the posterior median. Where the posterior
distributions were obtained using Stan probabilistic programming
language [@carpenter2016stan].

For each processing method we performed sixty-two independent
regressions.  In order to compare results between methods, we considered
the quantity $\delta^k = r^k_l - r^k_c$ and $\delta^k_{norm} =
\frac{r^k_l - r^k_c}{r^k_l + r^k_c}$, denoting the variance ratio for
the longitudinal method minus that of the cross-sectional method and the
normed difference between ratios, respectively (cf Figure ??). Since a large $r^k$
implies a higher between-subject to within-subject variability ratio, a
positive estimate of $\delta^k$ that is large in magnitude implies that
the longitudinal processing method is preferable to the cross-sectional
method.  Conversely, a negative estimate that is large in magnitude
implies that the cross-sectional processing method is preferable to the
longitudinal method.
