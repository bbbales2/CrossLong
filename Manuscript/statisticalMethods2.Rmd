## Statistical evaluation

Based on the above ANTs pipeline descriptions, there are three
major variants for cortical thickness processing of longitudinal data. We
denote these alternatives as:

* __ANTs Cross-sectional__ (or __ANTs Cross__). Process each subject's time point independently using the
  cross-sectional pipeline originally described in [@Tustison:2014ab].
* __ANTs Longitudinal-SST__ (or __ANTs SST__).  Rigidly transform each subject to the SST and then
   segment and estimate cortical thickness in the space of the SST.
* __ANTs Longitudinal-native__ (or __ANTs Native__).  Segment and estimate cortical thickness in the native space.

For completeness, we also include a comparison with both the cross-section and
longitudinal FreeSurfer v5.3 streams respectively denoted as "FreeSurfer Cross-sectional" (or
"FS Cross") and "FreeSurfer Longitudinal" (or "FS Long").

## Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation strategies

Possible evaluation strategies for cross-sectional methods have 
employed manual measurements in the histological [@rosas2002] or virtual [@kuperberg2003]
domains but would require an inordinate labor effort for collection
to be comparable with the size of data sets currently analyzed.  Other quantitative measures
representing "reliability," "reproducibility," or, more generally, "precision"
can also be used to characterize such tools.  For example, [@jovicich2013]
used FreeSurfer cortical thickness measurements across image
acquisition sessions to demonstrate improved reproducibility with the longitudinal
stream over the cross-sectional stream.  In [@Klein:2017aa]
comparisons for ANTs, FreeSurfer, and the proposed method were made using
the range of measurements and their correspondence to values published in the
literature.  However, none of these precision-type measurements, per se,
indicate the utility of a pipeline-specific cortical thickness value as a potential biomarker.
For example, Figure 8 in [@Tustison:2014ab] confirms what was found in [@Klein:2017aa]
which is that the range of ANTs cortical thickness values for a particular region
exceeds those of FreeSurfer.  However, for the same data, the demographic predictive
capabilities of the former was superior to that of the latter.  Thus, better
assessment strategies are necessary for determining clinical utility.  For example,
the intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient used
in [@Tustison:2014ab] demonstrated similarity in both ANTs and FreeSurfer
for repeated acquisitions despite the variance discrepancy between both sets of measurements.
This is understood with the realization that the ICC takes into account both inter-observer
and intra-observer variability.


Similarly, evaluation strategies for longitudinal studies have been proposed 
with resemblance to those employed for cross-sectional data such as the
use of visual assessment [@Li:2014aa], scan-rescan data 
[@Nakamura:2011aa;@Reuter:2012aa], 
and 2-D comparisons of post mortem images and corresponding MRI
[@Nakamura:2011aa].
In addition, longitudinal methods offer potential for other types of assessments
such as the use of simulated data (e.g., atrophy
[@Nakamura:2011aa;@Reuter:2012aa], infant development 
[@Li:2014aa]) where "ground-truth"
is known and
regression analysis of longitudinal trajectories of cortical 
thickness [@Li:2012aa].

## Cortical residual and between-subject thickness variability

For a longitudinal biomarker to be effective at classifying subpopulations, 
it should have low residual variation and high between-subject variation.
Without these simultaneous conditions, subpopulation distinctions would not be possible (e.g., if 
measurements within the subject vary more than those between subjects).
A summary measure related to the ICC statistic [@verbeke2009linear]
is used to quantify this intuition for assessing 
relative performance of these
cross-sectional and longitudinal ANTs pipeline variants along with the
cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer streams. Specifically, we use longitudinal
mixed-effects (LME) modeling to quantify pipeline-specific between-subject
and residual variabilities where comparative
performance is determined by maximizing the ratio between the former
and the latter.  Such a quantity implies greater within-subject reproducibility
while distinguishing between patient sub-populations. As such this
amounts to higher precision when cortical thickness is used as a predictor
variable or model covariate in statistical analyses upstream. 

LME models comprise a well-established and widely used class of regression models
designed to estimate cross-sectional and longitudinal linear associations between
quantities while accounting for subject-specific trends.  As such, these models
are useful for the analysis of longitudinally collected cohort data.
Indeed, [@Bernal-Rusiel:2013aa] provides an introduction to the mixed-effects methodology
in the context of longitudinal neuroimaging data and compare it empirically to
competing methods such as repeated measures ANOVA. For more complete treatments of
the subject matter, see [@verbeke2009linear] and [@fitzmaurice2012applied].
LME models are also useful for estimating and comparing residual and
between-subject variability after conditioning out systematic time trends in
longitudinally measured data.  In the context of the current investigation, by
fitting LME models to the data resulting from cross-sectional and longitudinal
processing techniques, we are able to quantify the relative performance of each approach
with respect to residual, between-subject, and total variability in a way that
[@reuter2012] hint at in their exposition of the longitudinal FreeSurfer stream.

As previously noted we observed a longitudinal sampling of cortical thickness measurements
from the 62 parcellated cortical DKT regions.  To assess the above variability-based criteria
while accounting for changes that may occur through the passage of time, we used a
Bayesian LME model for parameter estimation.  Let $Y^k_{ij}$ denote the $i^{th}$
individual's cortical thickness measurement corresponding to the $k^{th}$ region of
interest at the time point indexed by $j$.  Under the Bayesian paradigm we utilized 
a model of the form

\begin{gather}
\label{eq::lme1}
Y^k_{ij} \sim N(\alpha^k_i + \beta^k_i t,
\sigma_k^2) \\ \nonumber 
\alpha^k_i \sim N(\alpha^k_0, \tau^2_k) \qquad
\beta^k_i \sim N(\beta^k_0, \rho^2_k) \\ \nonumber 
\alpha^k_0, \beta^k_0 \sim N(0,10) \qquad 
\sigma_k,  \tau_k, \rho_k \sim \mbox{Cauchy}^+ (0, 5)
\end{gather}

where specification of variance priors to half-Cauchy distributions reflects commonly accepted best
practice in the context of hierarchical models [@gelman2006prior]. 
These priors concentrate mass near zero but have heavy tails, meaning small variance 
values are expected but large variance values are not prohibited.  Even so, results demonstrated 
robustness to parameter selection.

In Model (\ref{eq::lme1}),
$\tau_k$ represents the between-subject standard deviation, and $\sigma_k$ represents
the within-subject standard deviation, conditional upon time, and 
$\beta^i_k$ denotes the subject-specific slopes of cortical thickness change.
For each region $k$,
the quantity of interest is thus the ratio
\begin{equation}\label{eq::var_rat}
r^k = \frac{\tau_k}{\sigma_k}, \ k = 1, \dots, 62 \, .
\end{equation}
The posterior distribution of $r^k$ was summarized via the posterior
median where the posterior distributions were obtained using the Stan probabilistic
programming language [@carpenter2016stan].  The 
R interface to Stan was used to calculate the point estimates of Model (\ref{eq::lme1})
for cortical thickness across the different pipelines using the default parameters.
The csv files containing the regional cortical thickness values for all five pipelines, 
the Stan model file, and the R script to run the analysis and produce the plots 
are all located in the GitHub repository created for this work [@crossLong].

This ratio is at the heart of classical statistical discrimination methods as it
features both in the ANOVA methodology and in Fisher's linear discriminant analysis.
These connections are important since the utility of cortical thickness as a biomarker
lies in the ability to discriminate between patient sub-populations with respect to
clinical outcomes.
In particular, [@seber2012linear] 
(Sections 9.6.2 and 9.6.5) demonstrate the role that 
randomness and measurement error in explanatory variables play in statistical inference.
When the explanatory variable is fixed but measured with error (as is plausible for 
cortical thickness measurements), the residual variance divided by the between 
subject variance is proportional to the bias of the estimated linear coefficient when 
the outcome of interest is regressed over the explanatory variable (Example 9.2).  In 
short, the larger the $r^k$, the less bias in statistical analyses.
When the explanatory variable is considered random and
is measured with error (a common assumption in the measurement error literature
[@fuller2009measurement;@carroll2006measurement]), this bias is 
expressed as attenuation of regression coefficient estimates to zero by a multiplicative 
factor $r^k/(1+r^k)$ (Example 9.3). Thus, larger $r^k$ means less less attenuation bias 
and hence more discriminative capacity.
Note that effect estimator bias is not the only problem---the residual variance is 
increased by a factor proportional to $r^k/(1+r^k)$ 
([@seber2012linear], Chapter 3).  The same authors refer to the combination 
of bias and added variance as a ‘double whammy’.
Indeed, a worse reliability ratio causes greater bias in multiple linear regression in the 
presence of collinearity and even biases the estimators for other covariates, progression 
through time included (cf [@carroll2006measurement], Section 3.3.1). The same authors state that this bias is 
typical even in generalized linear models (Section 3.6) and use the ratio as a 
measure of reliability even in the longitudinal context (Section 11.9).


## Regional diagnostic contrasts based on cortical atrophy

The variance ratio explored in the previous section is a 
generic desideratum for statistical assessment of performance over the 
set of possible use cases.  In this section, we narrow the focus to the 
unique demographical characteristics of the ADNI-1 study data and look 
at performance of the various pipelines in distinguishing between diagnostic 
groups on a region-by-region basis.  Previous work has explored
various aspects of Alzheimer's disease with respect to its spatial distribution
and the regional onset of cerebral atrophy.  For example, although much 
work points to the entorhinal cortex as the site for initial deposition of
amyloid and tau [@Yassa:2014aa], other evidence points to the
basal forebrain as preceding cortical spread [@Schmitz:2016aa].  Other 
considerations include the use of hippocampal atrophy rates
as an image-based biomarker of cognitive decline [@Andrews:2016aa], 
differentiation from other dementia manifestations (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy 
[@Crutch:2017aa]), 
and the use of FreeSurfer for monitoring disease progression [@Falahati:2017aa].
Thus, longitudinal measurements have immediate application in Alzheimer's disease
research.  To showcase the utility of the ANTs framework, we compare the 
generated longitudinal measurements and their ability to differentiate diagnostic
groups (i.e., CN vs. LMCI vs. AD).

Pipeline-specific LME models were constructed for each DKT region
relating the change in cortical thickness to diagnosis and other pertinent covariates
taken directly from the ADNIMERGE package.  In the notation of [@wilkinson1973], these 
regional LME models are defined
as:
\begin{align}
\Delta Y^k_{ij} & = \beta_0 + Y_{i,bl}^k\, \beta_1 + AGE_{i,bl}\, \beta_2 + ICV_{i,bl}\, \beta_3 + APOE_i\, \beta_4 + GENDER_i \,\beta_5 \nonumber \\
           & + DIAGNOSIS_i\, \beta_6 + VISIT_{ij}\,\beta_7 + VISIT_{ij} \times DIAGNOSIS_i\,\beta_8  \nonumber \\
           &+ \alpha_i^k + \gamma_s^k + \epsilon_{ij}^k \, , 
\end{align}
where $\alpha_i^k$, $\gamma_s^k$, and $\epsilon_{ij}^k$  are independent, mean zero random variables representing individual-specific random intercepts, site-specific ($s$) random intercepts, and residual errors, respectively.

Here, $\Delta Y^k$ is the change in thickness of the $k^{th}$ DKT region from 
baseline (bl) thickness measurement $Y^k_{bl}$.  We also include random
intercepts for both the individual subject (ID) and the acquisition site.
Modeling was performed in R using the lme4 package [@JSSv067i01] followed
by Tukey post-hoc analyses with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment using the
multcomp package in R to test 
the significance of the LMCI$-$CN, AD$-$LMCI, and AD$-$CN diagnostic contrasts.
